# While Loops
Introduce `while` loops.

## Warmup
>What sorts of actions do you repeat in quick succession in your day-to-day life?

Examples: Walking, working out, spamming buttons while gaming

## Lecture
The [PowerPoint](WhileLoops.pptx) covers the syntax of while loops, along with some examples.

## Follow-Along Coding: Factorial
For the [code-along](FactorialFollowAlong.md), build up an application that calculates a factorial given a number from the user.

## Individual Coding: Even numbers
The students will follow the [instructions](EvenNumbersIndividualExercise.md) to create a program that prints out all even numbers from 0-100.

## Challenges
There are many [challenges](WhileLoopChallenges.md) for the students to complete.
