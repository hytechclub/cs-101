# While Loops Challenges
Complete the following challenges. It may be helpful to create a new `.cs` file for each challenge, or create a new project entirely.

## 1. While Loop Guessing game
Randomly pick a number, and use a `while` loop to ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 20. Make them guess until they are correct.

- If the users guess is too high tell them too high.
- If the guess is too low, tell them too low.
- If the guess is correct, congratulate them, and break out of the loop.

## 2. Calculate the next leap years
Leap years are defined as follows:
- If the year is divisible by `4` then it is a leap year
- Except if the year is divisible by `100` then it IS NOT a lear year
- Except if the year is divisible by `400` then it is a leap year

Write a program that does the following:
- Using the current year, generate the next 50 leap years
- Print those years to the console

## 3. Decreasing value
Repeatedly print the value of a variable `xValue`, decreasing it by `0.5` each time,
as long as `xValue` remains positive. Start by asking the user for a number, then store the value in the `xValue` variable.

## 4. Squares
Print the square of the first 25 odd positive integers.

## 5. Sums
Write a program with a `while` loop that computes the sum of first `n` positive integers:
```
sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n
```

### Examples
`n = 5`: `sum = 15`
`n = 19`: `sum = 190`

Allow the user to input the value of `n`.

## 6. Factors
Write a program that calculates the largest factor of a number (not including the number itself).

### Examples
`n = 24`: `output = 12`
`n = 19`: `output = 1`
`n = 27`: `output = 9`

Allow the user to input the value of `n`.

## 7. Diamond
Write a program that prints out an ASCII diamond of stars, with a height supplied by the user. The height is defined by the distance between the top line of stars and the middle line of stars.

### Examples
User inputs `1`:
```
 *
* *
 *
```

User inputs `3`:
```
   *
  * *
 *   *
*     *
 *   *
  * *
   *
```

## 8. Menu-based application
Create a calculator application where the user is prompted with a menu, and can select which function they would like to perform. If they ever enter an invalid input, they should be prompted again to enter a valid input. The application should allow the user to add, subtract, multiply, or divide. There should also be a secret option (not shown on the menu).
