# While Loops
Learn how to use `while` loops to execute code blocks multiple times. Review the PowerPoint presentation, and check out the [recap](WhileLoopRecap.md) for further review. After that, complete the [Factorial Follow-Along](FactorialFollowAlong.md) activity and the [Even Numbers Individual Exercise](EvenNumbersIndividualExercise.md). For more practice, work on the [Additional Exercises](WhileLoopBasicExercises.md). Beyond that, there are some challenges to complete as well.
