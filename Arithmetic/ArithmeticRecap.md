# Arithmetic Recap

We first learned how to use the basic mathematics operators in our code.

We add two numbers together using the `+` symbol.
We subtract two numbers together using the `-` symbol.
We multiply two numbers together using the `*` symbol.
We divide two numbers by using the `/` symbol.
 
```cs
int numberOne = 5;
int numberTwo = 5;

//Add two numbers together
int addingTwoNumbers = numberOne + numberTwo; 

//Subtract two numbers together
int subtractingTwoNumbers = numberOne - numberTwo; 

//Multiply two numbers together
int multiplyTwoNumbers = numberOne * numberTwo;

//Divide two numbers
int divideTwoNumbers = numberOne / numberTwo;
```

Next we learned about the modulus operation (`%`).

This special operation gives us the remainder of the division between two numbers.

```cs
int x = 5 % 3;
// x = 2 because 3 goes into 5, one time with 2 remaining.

int x = 13 % 4;
// x = 1 because 4 goes into 13, three times with 1 remaining.
```
