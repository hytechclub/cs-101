While arithmetic is not a long topic to cover, it is still an important one and most students will not have much difficult understanding this topic. Start by reviewing the basic operators that students would typically encounter, `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication) and `/` (division). Once students have seen each introduce them to the modulus operator (`%`), a few students in the past have found a practical application for this operator during final projects. Once students have used our basic operators to perform simple operations show them how we can condense these lines buy using `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--`, ect..
