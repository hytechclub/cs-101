# Collections (Arrays & Lists)

## Overview
Collections allow users to store multiple like values within a single object. Two common types of collections will be discussed, Arrays and Lists. Think of arrays has like items in a 1 by x size container, you as the user have the ability to place an object in one of the containers and at any given time be able to return to a specific spot and retrieve or replace an object in a specific slot. In programing, arrays store multiple values of the same data type, so an array can store multiple integers or multiple strings (or any data type for that matter!). The size of the array (or how many items it can hold) must be determined at creation and unfortunately, we are unable to modify its size after creation. 
However, that is where Lists become useful. While the syntax is slightly different, Lists have many of the same advantages as Arrays but we can modify how many items the list can hold at any given time. In order to access a specific item in a list you must address it by using its index value.

## Warm Up
>What are some things you might store in a list?

## Lecture
The lecture introduces both arrays and lists. The emphasis is on Lists (they are more useful in modern programming).

## Formative Assessment: Kahoot
The Kahoot quiz covers the content from the lecture: https://create.kahoot.it/share/c-101-collections/e1438fe4-431a-4fb0-9aaa-7d1b431852c7

## Follow-Along Activity: To-Do List
Complete the [ToDoListFollowAlong](ToDoListFollowAlong.md) activity as a group.

## Individual Exercise: To-Do List Updates
Students complete the [ToDoListIndividual](ToDoListIndividual.md) exercises on their own.

## Challenges
### Square Count Challenge (Less Challenging)
This challenge tasks the students with creating a program to count the number of squares between 0-N.

### To-Do List Challenge (More Challenging)
This challenge tasks the students with updating the to-do list application.

### Additional Challenges (?)
Further challenges for the students.
