## Icebreaker
This should be a quick activity so that the students can get to know each other a little bit.

## Kahoot
**Students should use their real name for this Kahoot!** The purpose of this Kahoot is to gather a snapshot of what the students knew going into C# 101 and compare to what they learned during the last week for 101. For this information to be useful it helps to see how each student performed. **Be sure to save the kahoot results!**
