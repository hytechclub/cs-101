## Icebreaker
This should be a quick activity so that the students can get to know each other a little bit. Use this [random question generator](https://replit.com/@JosephMaxwell/Icebreaker#main.cs) written in C# to kick things off.

## Code-Along
Explain the basics of C# during the [Hello World](HelloWorld.md) code-along activity.

## Next
After the brief introduction to C#, the next step should be the [Variables](../Variables/) lesson.
