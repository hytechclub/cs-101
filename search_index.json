101: Introduction to C#\nWelcome to the C# 101 Hy-Tech Club course!\nOnline Learning\n\nRead through this guide to learn about using repl.it\nThis is much more lightweight than Visual Studio and can be used for all C# 101 coding\n\n\nRecordings for lectures and code-alongs will be posted to this playlist\nJoin the Campfire Chat Room chat with instructors and other students\nOffice Hours will be held via Zoom on Tuesdays from 5:30PM-7PM\nIf asked, the password for the meeting is c101\n\n\nEmail c101@hyland.com with any questions\n\nWeekly Plan\nEach week, follow the same type of agenda we normally would follow in class:\n\nLecture: watch any lecture recordings before Office Hours on Tuesday\nCode-Along: watch any code-along recordings before Office Hours, OR start watching when Office Hours start so you can ask the instructors questions as you complete the activity\nIndividual Exercises: work on the individual exercises during Office Hours and ask the instructors questions as you complete the activities, OR complete the activities before Office Hours and login to Zoom to ask your questions\nChallenges: work on the challenges after completing the code-along\n\nSchedule\nFollow the links below to view each week of material.\n\nWeek 1 (2/11) - Hello C#\nWeek 2 (2/18) - Variables\nWeek 3 (2/25) - Conditionals\nWeek 4 (3/03) - Methods\nWeek 5 (3/10) - Method Parameters\nWeek 6 (3/17) - Boolean Operators\nWeek 7 (3/31) - While Loops\nWeek 8 (4/07) - Collections\nWeek 9 (4/14) - For Loops\nWeek 10 (4/21) - Final Project\nWeek 11 (4/28) - Project Work\nWeek 12 (5/05) - Project Presentations\n\nPoints\nEarn points throughout the semester by asking good questions, answering questions, helping others, working hard, and behaving well!\nRewards\nPoints can be redeemed for a variety of rewards.\n\n\n\nPoints\nReward\n\n\n\n\n1\nExtra piece of candy\n\n\n1\nRaffle ticket\n\n\n2\nShoot a paper basket for an extra point\n\n\n2\nPlay rock paper scissors against an instructor

that sets up the program. These parts of the code may be outside of the scope of this lesson. All that matters for simple scripts is the code between the { and } where the Console.WriteLine is now.

Even or Odd\nWrite a program that reads an integer from the user. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the integer is even or odd.\n2. Maximum of Three\nWrite a program that asks the user for three numbers. Then, your program should tell the user which of the numbers is the largest.\n3. Vowel or Consonant\nIn this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the\nletter is a consonant.\n4. Name that Shape\nWrite a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your program should display an appropriate error message.\n5. Month Name to Number of Days\nThe length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. Display \"28 or 29 days\" for February so that leap years are addressed.\n6. Name that Triangle\nA triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.\nWrite a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user. Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.\n7. Faces on Money\nWrite a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the user. Then, your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed if no such note exists.\n8. Season from Month and Day\nThe year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:\n\n\n\nSeason\nFirst Day\n\n\n\n\nSpring\nMarch 20\n\n\nSummer\nJune 21\n\n\nFall\nSeptember 22\n\n\nWinter\nDecember 21\n\n\n\nCreate a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date that was entered.\nNOTE: It may be helpful to use nested statements to complete this challenge\n9. Is a License Plate Valid?\nIn a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist of three uppercase letters followed by three numbers. When all of the license plates following that pattern had been used, the format was changed to four numbers followed by three uppercase letters.\nWrite a program that begins by reading a string of characters from the user. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the characters are valid for an older style license plate or a newer style license plate.

Decision Maker\nThroughout the course of a person's life, they will have to make a number of decisions. Some of these decisions may be quite difficult, and may require a great deal of thought. In these situations, it would be nice to have an algorithm that weighs the options, and outputs the optimal decision. Create a program that will make decisions for a person, given a group of weighted pros and cons.\nThe program should do the following:\n\nAsk the user what they would like to decide\nThey should fill in the blank: \"Should I ____?\"\n\n\nAsk the user for five \"pro\" arguments\nFor each \"pro\" argument, ask the user for a weighted value representing the importance of the item\nAsk the user for five \"con\" arguments, including weighted values\nPrint the list of pros and cons in an easily-digestable format\nCalculate the result by adding the weighted values on each side\nPrint out the final decision like so: \"You should ____\" OR \"You should NOT ____\"\n\nExtra Challenge\nAdapt your program so that it can choose between more than two options. For example, if the user were trying to choose between three different apartments to lease, they might use the rent price, the location, and the amenities to pick the best one. The program should be able to use at least 5 different criteria to compare three options, where each criterion has a weight, and each option has a value for each criterion. The program should then display the optimal choice.\n"},"Methods/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Methods/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - Methods","keywords":"","body":"C# 101: Methods\nReference\n\nVideo\nMethods PowerPoint Presentation\n\n"},"MethodParameters/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"MethodParameters/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 5 - Method Parameters","keywords":"","body":"C# 101: Method Parameters\nReference\n\nMethod Parameters PowerPoint Presentation\nParameters Video\nMethod Returns PowerPoint Presentation\nReturns Video\n\nActivities\n\nCalculator Follow-Along\n\nPractice\n\nCalculator Individual Instructions\nMethods Challenges\n\n"},"MethodParameters/MethodsRecap.html":{"url":"MethodParameters/MethodsRecap.html","title":"Recap","keywords":"","body":"Methods Recap\nMethods are what we use so that we don't have to repeat sections of code.

Let's look at how this might look in code:\nbool foundHam;\nbool foundTurkey;\nif (foundHam || foundTurkey)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am going to make a sandwich\");\n} \nelse \n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am going hungry for now\");\n}\n\nWe will write out \"I am going to make a sandwhich\" if you find ham OR if you find turkey OR if you find both (then you get to choose your protein!). However, if both foundHam and foundTurkey are set to false, you will not go into the curly braces immediately after the if statement. Instead you will go into the else block, and we will write, \"I am going hungry for now\".\nFinally, we learned about the most exciting operator: not! The not symbol is the exclamation point (!) What this does is flip the boolean value from true to false or from false to t`rue. Let's say you want to go to the pool, but the pool is only open if it is NOT raining:\nbool isRaining;\nif (!isRaining) \n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am going to the pool\");\n}\nelse \n{ \n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am not going to the pool\");\n}\n\nThe exclamation point flips the value if isRaining. So if it isRaining is set to true, then the if statement (!isRaining) will evaluate to false and you'll go into your else block where you say \"I am not going to the pool\" is. If isRaining is set to false then the if statement (!isRaining) will evaluate to true and you'll write \"I am going to the pool\"\n"},"BooleanOperators/BooleanOperatorsFollowAlong.html":{"url":"BooleanOperators/BooleanOperatorsFollowAlong.html","title":"Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"Boolean Operators - Follow-Along\nRead through the following for some examples of boolean operators.\n&& (Conditional And)\nLet's say you want to go build a snowman but you don't want your fingers to get cold.

The way our English and works in this sentence is pretty similar to how it works in code:\nbool snowOnGround; \nbool foundGloves; \nif (snowOnGround && foundGloves) \n{ \n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am going to build a snowman\"); \n}\nelse \n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am staying inside\");\n}\n\nThis if statement will only write \"I am going to build a snowman\" if BOTH the snowOnGround boolean AND the foundGloves boolean are true. If there's snow on the ground, but you did not find your gloves, you will not be able to build your snowman. If you found your gloves, but there's no snow outside, you won't be able to build that guy either. And if you don't have gloves and there's no snow, well you're really out of luck there. You'll have to stay inside.\n|| (Conditional Or)\nConditional Ors are evaluated to true if one of the conditions is true. Let's say you're considering eating some soup.

Let's say you want to go to school, but you can only go to school if you are NOT sick:\nbool feelingSick;\nif (!feelingSick) \n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"I am going to school!\");\n}\n\nThe exclamation point flips the value of feelingSick. So if feelingSick is set to true, then the if statement (!feelingSick) will evaluate to false and the program will not enter the if block. If feelingSick is set to false then the if statement (!feelingSick) will evaluate to true and the program will write \"I am going to school!\" \n"},"BooleanOperators/BooleanOperatorsExercises.html":{"url":"BooleanOperators/BooleanOperatorsExercises.html","title":"Exercises","keywords":"","body":"Boolean Operators - Exercises\nComplete the following exercises.\nBoolean Evaluation\nPart 1\nWhat is the boolean result of the following statements?\nDetermine what you think the answer is, and then write code to check your answer.\nExample: 25 == 25 -> true\n\n\"Random String\" != \"Random String\"\n15 > 7 \n27  \n\"My Name Is Jordan\" == \"my name is jordan\"\n35 >= 35 \n3.1254798  \n9001  \n\nPart 2\nWhat is the FINAL boolean result for the following conditional?\nExample ( true && true ) -> true\n\n(false || false)\n(true || false)\n(true && false)\n!(true && false)\n(false || (true && true))\n(true && (true && false))\n((false || !(true || false)) && !false)\n(false && (false || true))\n(3.1254798 \n(\"Random String\" != \"Random String\" || (27 = 35)\n(false || (true && (false || true) || !(true && false) || (true && false)))\n\nParking Challenge\nTake a look at the following set of parking ordinances: \n\nBased on the signs, determine if a user is able to park.\n\nAsk the user to provide the Day, Time of Day, and Length of parking time\nTell them how long they can park (2 hours, 4 hours, 0 hours, or no stopping)\n\n"},"BooleanOperators/LogicGatesChallenge.html":{"url":"BooleanOperators/LogicGatesChallenge.html","title":"Logic Gates Challenge","keywords":"","body":"Logic Gates\n\nIntroduction\nIn computing hardware, every circuit is built from boolean logic gates. These gates take in electrical signals (on or off) as input, and output electrical signals based on that input. For example, the NOT gate will output \"off\" if given \"on,\" and \"on\" if given \"off.\" The AND gate will take in two signals. It will output \"on\" if BOTH input signals are \"on,\" and output \"off\" otherwise. There are many additional gates, and the gates come together to build much larger circuits that do everything in a CPU.\nAll Logic Gates\nView the table in this Wikipedia article to learn about all the different logic gates: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate#Symbols\n\nNOT\nAND\nOR\nNAND\nNOR\nXOR\nXNOR\n\nTruth tables\nA truth table is a diagram in rows and columns showing how the truth or falsity of a proposition varies with that of its components.

Specifically For loops. So let's do a quick recap of the structure of these loops.\nfor (int i = 0; i \nInitialization\nfor loops are great when we know how many times we need to run through a process. It's structure allows us to declare how many times we wish to run through and we can even control how fast we reach that quote. So let's take a step back and pick apart its structure.\nint i = 0;\n\nThis is our initialization of the variable we are going to use to iterate through this loop. We can set the initial value to whatever makes sense for our application. It's important to note, we can use this variable within our loop however we would like but once we exit our loop this variable is no longer available to us.\nCondition\ni \nThis is our condition, as long as this statement returns true our loop will continue to execute. The evaluation takes place before our loop executes, and the loop will continue until this evaluates to false!\nIncrement\ni++\n\nThis is where we increment our initialized variable. In order for our loop to eventually come to an end we need to modify the value of i since thatâ€™s what our for loop looks for, and this where we do it. We donâ€™t have to increase the value by 1 (++`), we can modify it however we would like.\nExample\nAs an example lets write a program that will write 0-10 to the console window.\nfor (int i = 0; i \n"},"ForLoops/FizzBuzzFollowAlong.html":{"url":"ForLoops/FizzBuzzFollowAlong.html","title":"FizzBuzz Follow-Along","keywords":"","body":"FizzBuzz: Follow-Along\nFizzBuzz is a classic technical interview question.
