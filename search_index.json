These parts of the code may be outside of the scope of this lesson. All that matters for simple scripts is the code between the { and } where the Console.WriteLine is now. This part is called the body of the Main method. All the rest can be ignored to start.\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n    public static void Main (string[] args) {\n        // IMPORTANT STUFF GOES HERE\n    }\n}\n\nTIP - Specific Syntax\nMake sure every piece of code is exactly correct. C# is very particular, and if one letter is wrong, the whole program could crash.\nHere are some basic rules that can help deal with these errors:\n\nStatements should end with semi-colons (;)\nAny text to show the user should have an opening AND a closing quotation mark (\"\")\nMake sure capitalization is consistent\nMake sure parentheses open AND close (())\n\n"},"HelloCs/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"HelloCs/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 1 - C# Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Hello C#\nGet started with C#.

In C#, that line of code will display a message of \"Hello World\" in the console. Try to change the message from \"Hello World\" to something else!\nSetting the Console Colors\nIt is possible to change the colors of the C# console. There is a limited set of colors, but they can make the console a little bit more fun.\nAt the top of the body of the Main method, add the following code:\nConsole.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\nConsole.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue;\nConsole.Clear();\n\nThis will set the colors, and then clear the existing console so that the colors apply to everything.

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in computer programs. Legend has it that computer science pioneer Admiral Grace Hopper discovered the first ever computer bug back in the 1940s: an actual physical moth.\n\nToday, most debugging is done by walking through the code step-by-step. Replit does not have this capability for C#, but there are other ways to test code.\nError Messages\nThe most basic form of debugging involves running the code, and looking for error messages. They often look something like this:\n\nAn error like that one contains some important information:\n\nFile: main.cs\nLine Number and Position: (5,5)\nError Code: error CS0103\nError Message: The name 'console' does not exist in the current context\n\nUsing these clues, it will be possible to find the issue in the code.\nMisbehaving Code\nIf there are no errors, but the program does not run as expected, it can be a little more difficult to debug (especially without a true debugger tool).\nOne of the most common ways to figure out what's happening is to use print statements. In the case of C#, this means using Console.WriteLine. Printing out the value of a variable at a certain point in the code can make it much easier to tell what's going on. For example, in a complex math equation:\nint velocity = 2;\nint acceleration = 1;\nint time = 10;\n\nint start = 5 + 9;\nint additionalVel = velocity * time;\nint additionalAcc = .5 * acceleration * time * time;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(start + additionalVel + additionalAcc);\n\nIf the result is not expected, printing out each value (start, additionalVel, and additionalAcc) may indicate where the code went wrong. If the value of start is correct, and the value of additionalVel is correct, but the value of additionalAcc is not correct, that means something is wrong with the int additionalAcc line:\nint velocity = 2;\nint acceleration = 1;\nint time = 10;\n\nint start = 5 + 9;\nConsole.WriteLine(start);\n\nint additionalVel = velocity * time;\nConsole.WriteLine(additionalVel);\n\nint additionalAcc = .5 * acceleration * time * time;\nConsole.WriteLine(additionalAcc);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(start + additionalVel + additionalAcc);\n\nA Buggy Example\nTry out an example to see how the bug fixing process can work. There are five total bugs to be found! Fork this Repl project to begin.\nBug 1\nRun the code to see what's happening. Oh no! There are multiple errors! In Replit for C#, error messages appear in red.\nmain.cs(6,2): error CS1525: Unexpected symbol 'Console'\nmain.cs(7,78): error CS1525: Unexpected symbol ';', expecting ')' or ','\nWhenever there are multiple errors, try not to become to overwhelmed. Start with the first one:\nmain.cs(6,2): error CS1525: Unexpected symbol 'Console'\nIt looks like something is wrong on line 6... take a look at that line:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Graduation Year Calculator!\");\n\nIs there anything wrong with that code? It actually looks fine... but sometimes, an \"Unexpected symbol\" error happens on the line after where the error occurs. Check out line 5:\nConsole.Clear()\n\nIs there anything wrong with that code? ...Yes! It is missing a semi-colon (;). Add a semi-colon to the end of the line, run the code again, and verify that the error message is gone!\nBug 2\nOne of the error messages is gone, but there is still one remaining. Take a look at this one:\nmain.cs(7,78): error CS1525: Unexpected symbol ';', expecting ')' or ','\nBased on the output, something is going wrong on line 7, at character 78. The error message says there is a ; when there should be a ) or a ,. Take a look at line 7:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"We can estimate how long it will be until you graduate.\";\n\nToward the end of the statement... aha! There is no closing parenthesis. Before the semi-colon, add a ). Run the code again, and verify that this error message is gone!\nBug 3\nTwo down, three to go. After fixing those two errors, a couple more have cropped up. As before, start with the first error message:\nmain.cs(9,11): error CS0117: 'System.Console' does not contain a definition for 'Writeline'\nBased on the message, it is possible to deduce that the error is on line 9, character 11. It looks like Writeline is not defined, but that's strange... it seems to be working on the other lines. Take a look at the code on line 9:\nConsole.Writeline(\"\");\n\nHmm... I see! Instead of WriteLine, it has Writeline. The L must be capitalized in order for the code to work! Change it to WriteLine, run the code again, and verify that the error message disappears.\nBug 4\nNow, only one error should appear when the code runs. Take a look at the message:\nmain.cs(11,21): error CS0029: Cannot implicitly convert type 'string' to 'int'\nLine 11, character 21 - it seems to be something related to types. Go to line 11 to see what's happening:\nint age = Console.ReadLine();\n\nThe syntax all looks okay... what could it be? Oh yeah! Console.ReadLine() returns a string value, but the age variable is an int.\nOne idea would be to change the int to string in the code, but that will actually mess up some of the code below. Instead, the code should convert the string value from Console.ReadLine into an int value. Luckily, Convert.ToInt32 does just that.\nWrap the Console.ReadLine in a Convert.ToInt32(), run the code again, and verify that the error message disappears!\nBug 5\nNow, the program actually runs! Looks like there's nothing left to do... but wait. It would be a good idea to test out the program before calling it a day.\nRun the program, enter an age, and see how the calculation works. Not quite as intended. For example, entering 17 will say there are -35 years until graduation! That's not right. Entering 14 will say there are -32 years. The program definitely still has a bug.\nLooking at the code, it may not be immediately obvious where the bug occurs. One way to figure out what the code is doing is to add Console.WriteLine statements under each part, displaying information about the program at a certain point. This can help pinpoint the issue.\n\nAdd a Console.WriteLine statement under int age printing out the age: \"Age: \" + age\nAdd a Console.WriteLine statement under int birthYear printing out the birthYear value\nAdd additional Console.WriteLine statements for the other two variables: gradYear and yearsUntilGraduation\nRun the program\nEnter an age of 17 for testing purposes\nView the output, and notice that everything seems fine until the gradYear variable\nCheck the line where gradYear is set... there must be an issue\nNotice that the calculation is wrong - it should be addition, not subtraction!\nFix the bug\nRemove the extraneous Console.WriteLine statements\nTest the program again, and verify that it works!\n\nWell, that program had a lot of bugs, but fixing them one-by-one makes it much less overwhelming.\nMore Bug Fixes\nPractice debugging with these additional activities! Visit each Repl project, find the bugs, and make the programs work as intended.\n\nBug 1\nBug 2\nBug 3\nBug 4\n\n"},"UserInput/AboutYouIndividualExercises.html":{"url":"UserInput/AboutYouIndividualExercises.html","title":"About You Individual Exercises","keywords":"","body":"About Me - Individual Exercises\nComplete each of the exercises below to practice using Console.ReadLine and Convert.ToInt32.\n1.

This can be done using Console.WriteLine statements.

This statement should check if the player chose \"A\" as their option.\n\nUnder the Console.Clear(), make a new line\nType in if\nAfter that, type in parentheses ()\nAfter the parentheses, type in curly brackets {}\nPress enter within the curly brackets to space them out\nWithin the ( and ), add a boolean expression checking if the choice variable value is equal to \"A\"\n\nif (choice == \"A\")\n{\n\n}\n\nif Body\nNow the if condition is set up, but it needs to do something if the condition is true!\n\nWithin the { and }, make a new line\nAdd code to set the health variable to equal itself minus 1\nUnder that, still within the { and }, add a Console.WriteLine\nMake the WriteLine say that the pastry tasted good\n\nRun the program, and verify that entering \"A\" as the choice will make the message display! Entering anything else won't do anything yet...\nif (choice == \"A\")\n{\n    health = health - 1;\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You eat the donut, and it is delicious.\");\n}\n\nelse if\nNow the \"A\" choice has been handled, but what about \"B\"? Use an else if clause to handle the second option.\n\nUnder the } from the if, type in else if\nAfter the else if, add parentheses ()\nAfter the parentheses, add curly brackets {}\nMake the if condition (between parentheses) check if choice is \"B\"\nIn the body (between curly brackets), set health to itself minus 2\nUnder that, still in the else if body, add a Console.WriteLine\nMake the WriteLine say that the player is dealing with emotional pain\n\nRun the program again, and verify that entering either option will display the proper result!\nelse if (choice == \"B\")\n{\n    health = health - 2;\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You do not eat the donut, and the emotional pain takes its toll.\");\n}\n\nAnother Question\nAdding another question to the game will be very similar to the first question. For the next question, ask the player how they want to get to school.\n\nUnder the end of the else if block (after the }), make a new line\nDisplay a blank line, and then print out the current health variable valuable\nUnder that, display the question - ask the player how they get to school.\nUnder that, display the \"  A.

Or, create additional program files to complete these challenges. Use if, else, and else if (do not use any other control flow statements)!\n1. Even or Odd\nWrite a program that reads an integer from the user. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the integer is even or odd. Use this guide to help determine if an integer number is even or odd.\n2. Maximum of Three\nWrite a program that asks the user for three numbers. Then, your program should tell the user which of the numbers is the largest.\n3. Vowel or Consonant\nIn this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.\n4. Name that Shape\nWrite a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your program should display an appropriate error message.\n5. Month Name to Number of Days\nThe length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. Display \"28 or 29 days\" for February so that leap years are addressed.\n6. Name that Triangle\nA triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.\nWrite a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user. Display a message indicating the type of the triangle.\n7. Faces on Money\nWrite a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the user. Then, your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed if no such note exists.\n8. Season from Month and Day\nThe year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the exact dates that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the way that the calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:\n\n\n\nSeason\nFirst Day\n\n\n\n\nSpring\nMarch 20\n\n\nSummer\nJune 21\n\n\nFall\nSeptember 22\n\n\nWinter\nDecember 21\n\n\n\nCreate a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an integer. Then your program should display the season associated with the date that was entered.\nNOTE: It may be helpful to use nested statements to complete this challenge\n9. Is a License Plate Valid?\nIn a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist of three uppercase letters followed by three numbers. When all of the license plates following that pattern had been used, the format was changed to four numbers followed by three uppercase letters.\nWrite a program that begins by reading a string of characters from the user. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the characters are valid for an older style license plate or a newer style license plate. Your program should display an appropriate message if the string entered by the user is not valid for either style of license plate.\nREFERENCE: String (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.string?view=netframework-4.7.2)\n10. Decision Maker\nThroughout the course of a person's life, they will have to make a number of decisions. Some of these decisions may be quite difficult, and may require a great deal of thought. In these situations, it would be nice to have an algorithm that weighs the options, and outputs the optimal decision. Create a program that will make decisions for a person, given a group of weighted pros and cons.\nThe program should do the following:\n\nAsk the user what they would like to decide\nThey should fill in the blank: \"Should I ____?\"\n\n\nAsk the user for five \"pro\" arguments\nFor each \"pro\" argument, ask the user for a weighted value representing the importance of the item\nAsk the user for five \"con\" arguments, including weighted values\nPrint the list of pros and cons in an easily-digestable format\nCalculate the result by adding the weighted values on each side\nPrint out the final decision like so: \"You should ____\" OR \"You should NOT ____\"\n\nExtra Challenge\nAdapt your program so that it can choose between more than two options. For example, if the user were trying to choose between three different apartments to lease, they might use the rent price, the location, and the amenities to pick the best one. The program should be able to use at least 5 different criteria to compare three options, where each criterion has a weight, and each option has a value for each criterion. The program should then display the optimal choice.\n"},"WhileLoops/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"WhileLoops/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 4 - While Loops","keywords":"","body":"While Loops\nLearn how to use while loops to execute code blocks multiple times.

Specifically while loops. So let's do a quick recap of the structure of these loops.\nwhile (true)\n{\n    // do something\n}\n\nWhile loops are ideal when we don't know exactly how many times we need to execute our code, but we have a way of testing if we need to run it again, specifically using some type of Boolean expression.\nThe while loop only has one condition we need to worry about:\nwhile (/* some condition is TRUE */)\n\nSo what can this some condition be? Well it can be anything that equates to a boolean expression, some examples:\nwhile (Console.ReadLine() != \"STOP\") // as long as our user doesn't type 'STOP' we keep running our code\n\nint myInt = 0;\nwhile (myInt \nNow my last example in particular has a problem, can you spot what it is?

The goal of the program is to print out a message a certain number of times in a certain color, based on input from the user.\nPresentations\nEach student will be expected to present their project by the end of class. Presentations should cover the basic functionality of the program, and a look into the code. Students should be prepared to tell us how they successfully utilized each programming concept in their project. \nDepending on the time, it may be necessary to have students submit their projects instead of presenting. \nIf a student does not present or submit a project, we will reach out to the student's parent/guardian to make sure they want to continue with the club.\n"},"HalfProject/MessageRepeater.html":{"url":"HalfProject/MessageRepeater.html","title":"Message Repeater","keywords":"","body":"Message Repeater\nThis program should repeat a message a number of times using a user-defined color. Start by creating a new Repl project, and then complete each part below.\nAll changes should take place in the Main block (between the { and }). Refer back to the previous lessons for help.\nPart 1 - User Input\nThe first step is to retrieve some information from the user. Use Console.WriteLine, Convert.ToInt32, and Console.ReadLine to accomplish the two pieces below.\nHow Many Times?\nPrint out a message asking the user how many times they would like to repeat the message. Then, store their answer in a variable, converted to the proper numeric type.\nWhat Color?\nPrint out a message asking the user which color they would like to use. Then, store their answer in a new variable.\nPart 2 - Color Changer\nThe next step is to change the color of the text in the console based on the color the user entered. Use if/else if and Console.ForegroundColor to accomplish this.\nSupport at least three different colors from this list:\n\nConsoleColor.Red\nConsoleColor.Blue\nConsoleColor.Green\nConsoleColor.Yellow\nConsoleColor.Cyan\nConsoleColor.Magenta\n\nPart 3 - Repeating a Message\nThe final step is to print out a message the proper number of times. Feel free to use any appropriate message. Use a while loop and Console.WriteLine to accomplish this. To loop through a certain number of times, try this strategy:\n\nSet a new variable to 0\nFor the while condition (between parentheses), check if the new variable is less than the number of times to repeat\nIn the while body (between the curly brackets), add any code that will be repeated\nAlso in the while body, increment the new variable by 1\n\nPart 4 - Testing the Program\nNow that all the code should be complete, test the program and make sure it works. As the user, follow these steps:\n\nThe program should print a message asking how many times to repeat\nEnter a number of times (like 10)\nThe program should print a message asking which color to use\nEnter a color (like Red)\nThe program should repeat the message the proper number of times in the proper color!\n\nIt should look something like this:\n\n"},"Methods/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Methods/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 6 - Methods","keywords":"","body":"Methods\nLearn how to use methods to organize and manage code projects.

The body of the drawBunny method should contain the code that prints the bunny to the console. Once the method has been defined, remove the code from the Main method. Instead of using the Console.WriteLine statements in the Main method, call the drawBunny method a few times.\nCode\nusing System;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        drawBunny();\n        drawBunny();\n        drawBunny();\n    }\n\n    public static void drawBunny()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine();\n        Console.WriteLine(\" () ()\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\" (* *) \");\n        Console.WriteLine(\" (u u) \");\n        Console.WriteLine();\n    }\n}\n\nPart 3 - Updating the Method\nNow, if there is some change required to the bunny drawing, it is easy to change it!

For instance:\npublic static long\n\nThe long above means that this method will return a long, meaning if we want to store the result of the method in a new variable, that variable must be of type long.\nAny type we have learned in this class can be a return type but what if I don't want to return anything?\nNot all methods need to return something in this case we would place the word void where we previously had the word long\npublic static void\n\nYou might recognize the void terminology from the main method in every program you have written thus far.\nNext is the method name, we want to use descriptive names that tell a user at a glance what the method does.\npublic static double GetPerimeterOfRectangle\n\nIt should be obvious what GetPerimeterOfRectangle will give us a back the perimeter of some rectangle.\nHow does it know what the dimensions of the Rectangle are?\nWe have to tell it the dimensions, and we do this by defining the Method Parameters\npublic static double GetPerimeterOfRectangle(double sideA, double sideB, double sideC, double sideD)\n\nParameters are separated by commas and placed with Parenthesis next to the method name. A method may have any number of parameters including zero. The parameters are the only way to get information from another section of code.\nFollowing the parameters we write the code that will run whenever this method is used inside of {}, making sure to use the keyword return before the value we want to return if this method returns a value\npublic static double GetPerimeterOfRectangle(double sideA, double sideB, double sideC, double sideD)\n{\n    int perimeter = sideA + sideB + sideC + sided;\n    return perimeter;\n}\n\nCalling a Method\nFinally when calling a method we have to make sure to place an equal number of values in parenthesis to the number of parameters the method accepts.\npublic static void Main()\n{\n    int rectangleSideOne = 4;\n    int rectangleSideTwo = 6;\n    int rectangleSideThree = 7;   \n    int rectangleSideFour = 8;\n\n    int perimeter = GetPerimeterOfRectangle(rectangleSideOne, rectangleSideTwo, rectangleSideThree, rectangleSideFour); \n}\n\nMethods can be difficult to grasp but stick with it!

In the Main method, call each of the methods you define.\n1 - Is it a Leap Year?\nWrite a method that takes in a year and determines if it is a leap year.\nLeap years are defined as follows:\n\nIf the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year\nExcept if the year is divisible by 100 then it IS NOT a lear year\nExcept if the year is divisible by 400 then it IS a leap year\n\nWrite a program that asks the user for a year, and writes a message to the console telling the user whether or not the year they entered was a leap year.\n2 - Bunny Eyes\nDefine a method named drawBunny that prints an ASCII bunny to the console. It should look something like this:\n() ()\n(. .)\n(u u)\nOnce the method has been defined, update it so that it has a parameter. The parameter should determine the eyes for the bunny.\nExample 1\ndrawBunny(\"*\");\n\n() ()\n(* *)\n(u u)\nExample 2\ndrawBunny(\"-\");\n\n() ()\n(- -)\n(u u)\n3 - Repeat Message\nA user would like to be able to enter a message, and repeat it a certain number of times. For example, they could enter \"Hello\" and 3, and see the message \"Hello Hello Hello\". Define a method to handle this functionality.\nMethod Definition\n\nName: repeatMessage\nReturn type: void\nParameters: string message, int numberOfTimes\n\nUse a while loop in the body of the repeatMessage function to print out the message the proper number of times. Use Console.Write instead of Console.WriteLine to write all of the repetitions on the same line.\nMethod Call\n\nUse Console.WriteLine and Console.ReadLine to ask the user for a message, and store it in a variable named userMessage\nUse Console.WriteLine, Console.ReadLine, and Convert.ToInt32 to get the number of times to repeat the message, stored in a variable named num\nCall the repeatMessage method, and pass in userMessage and num\n\nRun the code, and verify that it is possible to enter a message and a number, and see the message repeat!\n4 - While Loop Methods\nUpdate the code from the While Loop Challenges so that each program is defined as one method. The Main method should have a menu that allows the user to select which method to run.\n5 - Recursion\n\nLand of Lakes Example\n\nIn computer science, recursion occurs when a method calls itself in its own definition. Read through this article to learn more.\nFibonacci Sequence\nThe Fibonacci Sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition. The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, so the whole sequence is:\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... and so on\nDefine a recursive fibonacci method that takes a number n and returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.\nExamples\n\nfibonacci(0) returns 0\nfibonacci(1) returns 1\nfibonacci(2) returns 1\nfibonacci(3) returns 2\nfibonacci(4) returns 3\nfibonacci(5) returns 5\nfibonacci(6) returns 8\n\nHint\nThe trick to defining a recursive method is to pretend the method is already defined. In the body of the fibonacci method, call the fibonacci method as if it will always return exactly what it should return.\n6 - Countdown\n\nNote: Google may be helpful for this challenge\n\nCreate a program that will ask the user for a date and the name of an event, and then display how many days there are until that date. For example, if today was 03/10/20 and the user entered 05/01/2020 as the date and my birthday as the event name, the program should say \"There are 52 days until my birthday.\"\n\nWrite a method that takes the date and determines the number of days until that date\nWrite another that asks the user to input a date and event name and outputs the message with the countdown\n\nChallenge items\n\nThe program should calculate the amount of time remaining in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds\nThe program should properly handle invalid input (e.g., fake months like Smarch or invalid numbers like the 28.3th of April)\nThe program should be able to handle a date provided in as many forms as possible (e.g., 03/09/2019, March 9th, 2019, 9 Mar 2019, the 9th of March in 2019)\n\nExtra challenge\n\nThe program should be able to display multiple countdowns at once\nThe program should store each countdown name/date in a text file, and load them from the text file each time the program runs\n\n"},"Practice/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"Practice/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 8 - Review and Practice","keywords":"","body":"Review & Practice\nTake some time to practice all of the concepts covered by the C# 101 course.

In this case, the player should face the monster and lose five health points.\n\nUnder the else if block }, make a new line\nCreate an else if structure using else if () { }\nFor the condition, check if the user typed in \"path\"\nFor the body, display a message saying the player faced the monster\nAlso in the body, set health to itself minus five\n\nRun the program, and verify that it is possible to visit the path. The new message should only appear if the player types in \"path\" when prompted! The new code should look something like this: \nelse if (go == \"path\")\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You go down the path and face the monster.\");\n    health = health - 5;\n}\n\nGoing Somewhere Invalid\nNow the player can successfully visit all of the places, but they might type in something else. Handle this case by telling them they entered an invalid option.\n\nUnder the else if block }, make a new line\nCreate an else structure using else { }\nNote that there is no condition for an else\n\n\nFor the body, display a message saying invalid option\n\nRun the program, and verify that the message appears when it should. The new message should only appear if the player types in something other than \"barn\", \"tree\", or \"path\" when prompted! The new code should look something like this: \nelse\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid option.\");\n}\n\nEnd Result\nLastly, the player's final health will determine whether or not they survive. Print out a message with this information at the end of the program.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the main block\nCreate an if/else structure using if () { } else { }\nFor the if condition, check if the health variable is less than 1\nIn the body of the if, print out \"You have died.\"\nIn the body of the else, print out \"You make it out of the woods.\"\n\nRun the program, and verify that the proper message appears based on the user choice! If the user goes down the path, they should die. Otherwise, they should live.

This code-along covers while loops.\nStarting Point\nFor this code-along, start from the ending point of part three. If needed, fork this Repl project to begin.\nNote that for this activity, a lot of the code will need to move around. This can be challenging because the code already exists, it just needs to be moved to a different place. Make sure everything goes where it should!\nAn Infinite Loop\nStart by creating a simple loop structure that will keep going forever.\n\nMake a new line under the health variable declaration\nCreate a new bool variable named keepGoing set to true\nUnder that, create a while loop structure with while () { }\nFor the while condition, use keepGoing\nFor now, in the body of the while loop, display a message of \"\\nHello\" + name\n\nAt this point, running the code should print out \"Hello\" infinitely. Eventually, this should be fixed, but for now, that is the intended result! The code for this part should look something like this:\nint health = 5;\nbool keepGoing = true;\n\nwhile (keepGoing)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"\\nHello \" + name);\n}\n\nLooping Options\nNow that the loop is set up, it's time to make it loop the options infinitely. Instead of simply infinitely printing out \"Hello\", it should keep asking the user what to do, and respond appropriately. The code is already there, it just needs to go in the right place.\n\nFind the Console.WriteLine(\"\\nHello \" + name); line in the code\nFind the else { Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid option.\"); } block in the code\nHighlight and copy all of the code between those parts\nPaste all that code into the body of the while loop\nIndent the pasted code for readability\nRemove the code that was copied from its original place\n\nNow, running the program should infinitely print out options for the player. The health value should update each time through the loop, as long as a valid option is entered. The code should look something like this:\nwhile (keepGoing)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"\\nHello \" + name);\n\n    /* copied code */\n}\n\nif (health \nStopping the Loop\nThe loop should not actually be infinite - there should be a way to get out of it. The game should end when the player decides to go down the path.\n\nFind the else if checking if the player decides to go down the path\nMake a new line in the body of the else if, at the bottom\nThere, set the keepGoing variable to false\n\nRun the program again, and verify that it is possible to exit the loop when choosing to go down the path! The player should now be able to win or lose based on what they do prior to going down the path.\nThe code for this part should look like this:\nelse if (go == \"path\")\n{\n    /* ... */\n    keepGoing = false;\n}\n\nNow the game is starting to feel a bit more game-y. There are different outcomes in a more long term way.\nFinal Program\nBy the end of this code-along, the main.cs file should look something like this:\nusing System;\n\nclass Program {\n  public static void Main (string[] args) {\n    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.White;\n    Console.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkRed;\n    Console.Clear();\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You awaken in a strange place.\");\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You see a barn, a big tree, and a path through the woods.\\n\");\n\n    Console.WriteLine(\"What is your name?\");\n    string name = Console.ReadLine();\n    int health = 5;\n    bool keepGoing = true;\n\n    while (keepGoing)\n    {\n      Console.WriteLine(\"\\nHello \" + name);\n      Console.WriteLine(\"Your health is \" + health);\n\n      Console.WriteLine(\"\\nWhere do you go?
