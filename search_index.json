and click the \"Sign up\" button \nIf necessary, prove your humanity to verify the account\nOpen your email, and click the \"Complete Verification\" link \nOn your repls page, click the \"+ new repl\" button \nSelect \"C#\" from the Language list\nEnter a name for the Repl, like \"HelloWorld\"\nClick the \"Create Repl\" button to create the new project! \n\nRepl Overview\nrepl.it is a website that allows developers to write and run code right from a web browser!\n\n\nCode Editor - This is where developers write code\nRun Button - Developers click this button to execute the code\nRun Area - This is where the developer sees the results of the code\n\nIn the new Repl, click the \"run\" button to see the code execute!\nTIP - C# Script Structure\nIn the code, there is a lot of boiler-plate code that sets up the program. These parts of the code may be outside of the scope of this lesson. All that matters for simple scripts is the code between the { and } where the Console.WriteLine is now. This part is called the body of the Main method. All the rest can be ignored to start.\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n    public static void Main (string[] args) {\n        // IMPORTANT STUFF GOES HERE\n    }\n}\n\nTIP - Specific Syntax\nMake sure every piece of code is exactly correct. C# is very particular, and if one letter is wrong, the whole program could crash.\nHere are some basic rules that can help deal with these errors:\n\nStatements should end with semi-colons (;)\nAny text to show the user should have an opening AND a closing quotation mark (\"\")\nMake sure capitalization is consistent\nMake sure parentheses open AND close (())\n\n"},"HelloCs/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"HelloCs/StudentDesc.html","title":"Week 1 - C# Introduction","keywords":"","body":"C# 101: Hello C#\nComplete the Hello World activity to get started with C#!\nVariables & Data Types PowerPoint Presentation\n\n\nActivities\n\nAbout Me Code-Along\nAbout Me Challenge\n\n"},"HelloCs/HelloWorld.html":{"url":"HelloCs/HelloWorld.html","title":"Hello World","keywords":"","body":"Hello World!\nIn this lesson, create a simple application to show a message in the console using C#. C# is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language designed by Microsoft. Developers use C# to make web servers, desktop applications, games, and much more.\nGetting Started with a New Repl Account\nFollow the Repl Setup guide to create an account and a new Repl project.\nUsing Console.WriteLine\nThe default code in the new Repl project should look something like this:\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n  public static void Main (string[] args) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n  }\n}\n\nThe important line is Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");. In C#, that line of code will display a message of \"Hello World\" in the console. Try to change the message from \"Hello World\" to something else!\nSetting the Console Colors\nIt is possible to change the colors of the C# console. There is a limited set of colors, but they can make the console a little bit more fun.\nAt the top of the body of the Main method, add the following code:\nConsole.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\nConsole.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue;\nConsole.Clear();\n\nThis will set the colors, and then clear the existing console so that the colors apply to everything. Make sure the capitalization is consistent!\nTry out a few different colors to see what works.\n"},"Variables/AboutMeCodeAlong.html":{"url":"Variables/AboutMeCodeAlong.html","title":"About Me Code-Along","keywords":"","body":"About Me Code-Along: Hard-Coded Values\nstring userName = \"Jordan Conrad\";\nint userAge = 27;\nint numberOfPets = 2;\nstring schoolAttended = \"Medina High School & Baldwin Wallace University\";\n\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello!

Maximum of Three\nWrite a program that asks the user for three numbers. Then, your program should tell the user which of the numbers is the largest.\n3. Vowel or Consonant\nIn this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant. Otherwise your program should display a message indicating that the letter is a consonant.\n4. Name that Shape\nWrite a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your program should display an appropriate error message.\n5. Month Name to Number of Days\nThe length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. Display \"28 or 29 days\" for February so that leap years are addressed.\n6. Name that Triangle\nA triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.\nWrite a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.

In these situations, it would be nice to have an algorithm that weighs the options, and outputs the optimal decision. Create a program that will make decisions for a person, given a group of weighted pros and cons.\nThe program should do the following:\n\nAsk the user what they would like to decide\nThey should fill in the blank: \"Should I ____?\"\n\n\nAsk the user for five \"pro\" arguments\nFor each \"pro\" argument, ask the user for a weighted value representing the importance of the item\nAsk the user for five \"con\" arguments, including weighted values\nPrint the list of pros and cons in an easily-digestable format\nCalculate the result by adding the weighted values on each side\nPrint out the final decision like so: \"You should ____\" OR \"You should NOT ____\"\n\nExtra Challenge\nAdapt your program so that it can choose between more than two options. For example, if the user were trying to choose between three different apartments to lease, they might use the rent price, the location, and the amenities to pick the best one. The program should be able to use at least 5 different criteria to compare three options, where each criterion has a weight, and each option has a value for each criterion.

Follow the steps for multiplication, but use the division operator instead.\nCHALLENGE: Quadratic Formula\n\nAllow the user to enter an additional number (c)\nDefine a method that takes three inputs (a, b, and c), and returns one of the results of the quadratic formula: https://www.purplemath.com/modules/quadform.htm#distform\nIf the user enters \"quadratic\" for the operation they would like to perform, call the quadratic formula method on the inputs\nPrint the result to the console in the form \"x = {answer}\"\n\nEXTRA CHALLENGE:\n\nLearn about C# out parameters: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-parameter-modifier\n\nUse an out parameter so that the program can return both results of the quadratic formula, and print both to the console.\n"},"MethodParameters/MethodsChallenges.html":{"url":"MethodParameters/MethodsChallenges.html","title":"Challenges","keywords":"","body":"Methods Challenges\nComplete the exercises below using a single .cs file. In the Main method, appropriately call each of the methods you define.\n1 - Calculate the next leap years\nWrite a method that takes in a year and determines if it is a leap year.\nLeap years are defined as follows:\n\nIf the year is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year\nExcept if the year is divisible by 100 then it IS NOT a lear year\nExcept if the year is divisible by 400 then it IS a leap year\n\nWrite a program that asks the user for a year, and writes a message to the console telling the user whether or not the year they entered was a leap year.\nChallenge\nWrite a program that does the following:\n\nUsing the current year, generate the next 50 leap years\nPrint these years out to the console\n\n2 - Countdown\nCreate a program that will ask the user for a date and the name of an event, and then display how many days there are until that date. For example, if today was 03/10/20 and the user entered 05/01/2020 as the date and my birthday as the event name, the program should say \"There are 52 days until my birthday.\"\n\nWrite a method that takes the date and determines the number of days until that date\nWrite another that asks the user to input a date and event name and outputs the message with the countdown\n\nChallenge items\n\nThe program should calculate the amount of time remaining in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds\nThe program should properly handle invalid input (e.g., fake months like Smarch or invalid numbers like the 28.3th of April)\nThe program should be able to handle a date provided in as many forms as possible (e.g., 03/09/2019, March 9th, 2019, 9 Mar 2019, the 9th of March in 2019)\n\nExtra challenge\n\nThe program should be able to display multiple countdowns at once\nThe program should store each countdown name/date in a text file, and load them from the text file each time the program runs\n\n3 - Recursion\n\nLand of Lakes Example\n\nIn computer science, recursion occurs when a method calls itself in its own definition. Read through this article to learn more.\nFibonacci Sequence\nThe Fibonacci Sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to have a recursive definition. The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum of the previous two values, so the whole sequence is:\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... and so on\nDefine a recursive fibonacci method that takes a number n and returns the nth fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.\nExamples\n\nfibonacci(0) returns 0\nfibonacci(1) returns 1\nfibonacci(2) returns 1\nfibonacci(3) returns 2\nfibonacci(4) returns 3\nfibonacci(5) returns 5\nfibonacci(6) returns 8\n\nHint\nThe trick to defining a recursive method is to pretend the method is already defined. In the body of the fibonacci method, call the fibonacci method as if it will always return exactly what it should return.\n"},"FinalProject/FinalProject.html":{"url":"FinalProject/FinalProject.html","title":"Week 9 - Final Project","keywords":"","body":"Final 3 weeks: Project time!\nShow us what you learned!\nThe last 2 weeks are for you to create a project.
