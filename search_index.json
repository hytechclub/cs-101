Maximum of Three\nWrite a program that asks the user for three numbers. Then, your program should tell the user which of the numbers is the largest.\n3. Vowel or Consonant\nIn this exercise you will create a program that reads a letter of the alphabet from the user. If the user enters a, e, i, o or u then your program should display a message indicating that the entered letter is a vowel. If the user enters y then your program should display a message indicating that sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes y is a consonant.

Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your program should display an appropriate error message.\n5. Month Name to Number of Days\nThe length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your program should display the number of days in that month. Display \"28 or 29 days\" for February so that leap years are addressed.\n6. Name that Triangle\nA triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 3 sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are the same length, and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different lengths then the triangle is scalene.\nWrite a program that reads the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle from the user.

Then, your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed if no such note exists.\n8. Season from Month and Day\nThe year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter.

Is a License Plate Valid?\nIn a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist of three uppercase letters followed by three numbers. When all of the license plates following that pattern had been used, the format was changed to four numbers followed by three uppercase letters.\nWrite a program that begins by reading a string of characters from the user.

In these situations, it would be nice to have an algorithm that weighs the options, and outputs the optimal decision. Create a program that will make decisions for a person, given a group of weighted pros and cons.\nThe program should do the following:\n\nAsk the user what they would like to decide\nThey should fill in the blank: \"Should I ____?\"\n\n\nAsk the user for five \"pro\" arguments\nFor each \"pro\" argument, ask the user for a weighted value representing the importance of the item\nAsk the user for five \"con\" arguments, including weighted values\nPrint the list of pros and cons in an easily-digestable format\nCalculate the result by adding the weighted values on each side\nPrint out the final decision like so: \"You should ____\" OR \"You should NOT ____\"\n\nExtra Challenge\nAdapt your program so that it can choose between more than two options. For example, if the user were trying to choose between three different apartments to lease, they might use the rent price, the location, and the amenities to pick the best one. The program should be able to use at least 5 different criteria to compare three options, where each criterion has a weight, and each option has a value for each criterion.

Sums\nWrite a program with a while loop that computes the sum of first n positive integers:\nsum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nExamples\nn = 5: sum = 15\nn = 19: sum = 190\nAllow the user to input the value of n.\n6. Factors\nWrite a program that calculates the largest factor of a number (not including the number itself).\nExamples\nn = 24: output = 12\nn = 19: output = 1\nn = 27: output = 9\nAllow the user to input the value of n.\n7. Diamond\nWrite a program that prints out an ASCII diamond of stars, with a height supplied by the user. The height is defined by the distance between the top line of stars and the middle line of stars.\nExamples\nUser inputs 1:\n *\n* *\n *\nUser inputs 3:\n   *\n  * *\n *   *\n*     *\n *   *\n  * *\n   *\n8. Menu-based application\nCreate a calculator application where the user is prompted with a menu, and can select which function they would like to perform. If they ever enter an invalid input, they should be prompted again to enter a valid input. The application should allow the user to add, subtract, multiply, or divide. There should also be a secret option (not shown on the menu).\n"},"WhileLoops/WhileLoopsPractice.html":{"url":"WhileLoops/WhileLoopsPractice.html","title":"Week 5 - While Loops Practice","keywords":"","body":"C# 101: While Loops Practice\nBuild a program that uses while loops to accomplish something.

They allow us to reuse the same code over and over again throughout our program. \nDefining a Method\nWhen defining a new method we always have to include certain pieces of information.\nWe start with\npublic static\n\nThese two words will be at the beginning of all the methods you are likely to write in this course.\nWe follow public static with a return type, this tells other people what kind of information you will return. For instance:\npublic static long\n\nThe long above means that this method will return a long, meaning if we want to store the result of the method in a new variable, that variable must be of type long.\nAny type we have learned in this class can be a return type but what if I don't want to return anything?\nNot all methods need to return something in this case we would place the word void where we previously had the word long\npublic static void\n\nYou might recognize the void terminology from the main method in every program you have written thus far.\nNext is the method name, we want to use descriptive names that tell a user at a glance what the method does.\npublic static double GetPerimeterOfRectangle\n\nIt should be obvious what GetPerimeterOfRectangle will give us a back the perimeter of some rectangle.\nHow does it know what the dimensions of the Rectangle are?\nWe have to tell it the dimensions, and we do this by defining the Method Parameters\npublic static double GetPerimeterOfRectangle(double sideA, double sideB, double sideC, double sideD)\n\nParameters are separated by commas and placed with Parenthesis next to the method name. A method may have any number of parameters including zero. The parameters are the only way to get information from another section of code.\nFollowing the parameters we write the code that will run whenever this method is used inside of {}, making sure to use the keyword return before the value we want to return if this method returns a value\npublic static double GetPerimeterOfRectangle(double sideA, double sideB, double sideC, double sideD)\n{\n    int perimeter = sideA + sideB + sideC + sided;\n    return perimeter;\n}\n\nCalling a Method\nFinally when calling a method we have to make sure to place an equal number of values in parenthesis to the number of parameters the method accepts.\npublic static void Main()\n{\n    int rectangleSideOne = 4;\n    int rectangleSideTwo = 6;\n    int rectangleSideThree = 7;   \n    int rectangleSideFour = 8;\n\n    int perimeter = GetPerimeterOfRectangle(rectangleSideOne, rectangleSideTwo, rectangleSideThree, rectangleSideFour); \n}\n\nMethods can be difficult to grasp but stick with it!

The first two values in the sequence are 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases).
