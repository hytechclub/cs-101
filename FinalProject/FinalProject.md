# Final 3 weeks: Project time!
Show us what you learned!

The last 2 weeks are for students to create their projects, what specifically they create is up to you! These projects should be done individually.

## Examples
- Hangman
- Create your own story
- Mad-lib generators
- Simple databases with menu options
- Rock paper scissors!

## Technical Requirements
1. Use a loop! Can be `for`, `foreach` or `while`. Up to you!
1. Use at least one method, show us you understand how to use them

## Presentations
Students will be expected to present their projects at the last meeting of the semester.

### Content
The presentation should include:

- Background about the idea behind the app
- An overview of the app's functionality
- An explanation of any new topics learned
- A brief look into any relevant or interesting parts of the code
- A discussion of any challenges that arose during the project development

### Procedure

- If a student is able to share their screen and talk through their project on Zoom, that is preferred
    - If a student does not have a microphone, they can join the Zoom meeting from a telephone
    - If a student cannot share their screen, they should e-mail their code to [c101@hyland.com](mailto:c101@hyland.com)
- A student also has the option of recording a video presentation
- There will be a defined schedule and order for each student to present
- **If a student does not present a final project, they may not be able to move onto the next level of Hy-Tech Club**
