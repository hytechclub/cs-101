# Projects
Past experiences:
	It is advised students work alone, in group projects it has been difficult to see who actually did the majority of the work and if anyone was lacking understanding. Working solo will help better advice who should move on to advanced and who should retake

The last week:
	Present project to class! Run through the application once to show us what it does. Then have students show and explain what their loop and method do (just so we know they use them)
