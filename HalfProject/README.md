# Mid-Semester Project / Assessment
There are two purposes for this week:

1. The students should get a chance to review/practice all of the concepts covered so far
1. The instructors should get some insight into each student's progress

## Review Game
Start by playing the [While Loops Practice Game](WhileLoopsPracticeGame.pptx). Instructions are within the PowerPoint presentation. This game reviews `while` loops.

## Project Work
After the game, introduce the [Mid-Semester Project](StudentDesc.md). The students will have the majority of class time to work on their projects. There are no specific requirements, other than successfully utilizing some input/output, at least one `while` loop, and at least one `if` statement.

## Project Presentations / Submissions
By the end of the meeting, each student should either present or submit their projects. Submissions can be via private Zoom chat, Discord, e-mail, or google form. This will give the instructors a chance to review, and make sure that no students are falling behind significantly.
