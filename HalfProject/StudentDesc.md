# Mid-Semester Practice / Assessment
The goal of this week is to build a program that uses all of the skills introduced in this course so far. There are no specific functional requirements, but the program should utilize all of the following:

- At least one `while` loop
  - Refer to the [While Loops content](../WhileLoops/StudentDesc.md) to review
- At least one `if` statement
  - Refer to the [Conditionals content](../Conditionals/StudentDesc.md) to review
- Input and Output
  - Refer to the [User Input content](../UserInput/StudentDesc.md) to review

## Originality
Project ideas do not have to be original; for example, multiple students may decide to build a guessing game. However, each student _must_ write their own code; finding code from the internet or sharing code with a friend will not be tolerated. The instructors hope to see what each student is capable of creating on their own!

## Ideas
Some of the [While Loop Challenges](../WhileLoops/WhileLoopChallenges.md) could be used as project ideas, including:
- While Loop Guessing Game
- Next Leap Years
- Squares
- Diamond
- Menu-based application

Other ideas include:
- RPG game with a menu
- Repeating ASCII art
- Input validation check (password checker or something similar)

For a little more guidance, try the [Message Repeater](MessageRepeater.md) challenge. The goal of the program is to print out a message a certain number of times in a certain color, based on input from the user.

## Presentations
Each student will be expected to present their project by the end of class. Presentations should cover the basic functionality of the program, and a look into the code. Students should be prepared to tell us how they successfully utilized each programming concept in their project. 

Depending on the time, it may be necessary to have students submit their projects instead of presenting. 

**If a student does not present or submit a project, we will reach out to the student's parent/guardian to make sure they want to continue with the club.**
