# About Me Challenge
Add more information to the "About Me" program. This can be any type of information about you that you would like to share with the user of your program.

Repeat these steps:

1. Come up with an interesting piece of information to share (feel free to use the ideas listed below)
1. Determine the _data type_ for the information: `string`, `int`, `double`, or `boolean`
1. Come up with a good _variable name_
1. Declare and set the _variable value_ to your information
1. Finally, display the information to the console in a nice message.

The code may look something like this:

```cs
int numFollowers = 40;
Console.WriteLine("Number of Followers: " + numFollowers);
```

Try to add as much information as possible!

## Ideas for Information
- Favorite Sport
- GPA
- Temperature
- Favorite Movie
- Organ Donor
- Birth Year
- Height
- Number of Siblings
- Right-Handed
- Favorite Song
- Amount of Money in Savings Account (feel free to lie)
- Vegetarian
- Grade Level

## Console Colors Challenge
Before each piece of information, set the color of the text in the console. The code to do that looks like this:

```cs
Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;
```

For more information, and for the complete list of possible colors, check out [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.consolecolor?view=netframework-4.8#fields). Try to change every single piece of information to be a different color!

## ASCII Art
Try to add some ASCII art to the page to make it a little more flashy. Try out this [image to ASCII converter](https://manytools.org/hacker-tools/convert-images-to-ascii-art/) or this [text generator](https://www.colorschemer.com/ascii-art-generator/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=type%20something...). Use `Console.WriteLine` statements to make the art appear in the program!s

Note that in C#, the backslash character (`\`) will not work within a string. Use two backslashes in a row to make one appear.
