# Week 2: Console.WriteLine(), variables, data types and user input

## Overview
As an introductory to the class, expose students to the Console Application. With this first step into C# students will need to learn the basic operations to use within a Console Application such as WriteLine(). 
Students will also need to become familiar with the concept of a Variable, a named location in memory used to store data. In order to use variables students will need know the different data types that we will be associating with variables: `int`, `long`, `bool`, `double` and `string`. Students should develop an understanding of what each data type is and how to use them appropriately. 


## Class Objective
- Explain what a variable is: a **named location in memory**
- Explain the different value data types
    - `string`, `int`, `double`, `bool`
- Example of cups as variables can be useful
    - Cups can store things and you need a label to identify them
    - Different types of cups hold different liquids, i.e. coffee vs soda as analog for data types
- Explain how to get user input and convert if need be
    - `Console.ReadLine()`
    - `Convert.To`
- Code along an "About me" Program
    - Use a series of datatypes to output information like age, name, number of pets, ect..
    - Optionally get user input to set variable values
- Combine the concepts to make a superhero quiz
