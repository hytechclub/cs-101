# Variables & Data Types
Introduce variables in C#, and go over the basic data types: `string`, `int`, `double`, `bool`.

Example of cups as variables can be useful:
- Cups can store things and you need a label to identify them
- Different types of cups hold different liquids, i.e. coffee vs soda as analog for data types

## Lecture
Present the [Variables](Variables.pptx) PowerPoint presentation to introduce the concepts.

## Code-Along
Create a new Repl project, and add code for the [About Me](AboutMeCodeAlong.md) code-along activity.

## Individual Work
Students can complete the [About Me](AboutMeChallenge.md) challenge.
