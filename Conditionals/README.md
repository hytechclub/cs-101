# Conditional Statements

## Overview
Introduce the concept of adding logic to applications using `if` statements. Students will be introduced to the structure of the logic: "if something is true (or false) then do this." Since `if` statements assess some type of conditional statement, students will need to learn the simple Boolean operators: `<`, `>`, `==`, `<=`, `>=`. These conditional statements take a set of values or parameters and equate them to a `true` or `false` value. Starting conditionals use `==`.

After students have some exposure to `if`, introduce them to `else if` and the catch-all `else`. Students should develop an understanding of when an `if`, `else if`, `else` logic tree executes the code in each segment (why some blocks may be skipped) and why using a series of `if` statements might not work.

## Lecture
Present the [Conditional Statements](ConditionalStatements.pptx) PowerPoint.

## Group Activity: Code-Along
Complete the [code-along](ConditionalsCodeAlong.md) with the students.

## Baamboozle Team Quiz
Split the room up into two teams, and play this [baamboozle quiz game](https://www.baamboozle.com/game/336124). The quiz covers the content from this lesson, as well as some review of the previous lessons.

Make sure the students are **not** able to see the game code in the URL at any point. The answers are publicly available online, so if they see the game code, the students may be able to cheat.

## Individual Exercises
Students should complete the [Conditional Exercises](ConditionalExercises.md).

## Challenges
If a student has completed the individual exercises, they should work on the [Challenges](ConditionalChallenges.md).
