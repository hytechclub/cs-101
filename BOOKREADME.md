# C# 101: Introduction to <span>C#</span>
Welcome to the C# 101 Hy-Tech Club course!

## Online Learning
- Read through [this guide](UsingRepl.md) to learn about using `repl.it`
    - This is much more lightweight than Visual Studio and can be used for all C# 101 coding
- Recordings for lectures and code-alongs will be posted to [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1P_sExxi-9PSNwmays_UE8JYllVu7P7u)
- Office Hours will be held via [Zoom](https://hyland.zoom.us/j/226881964) on Tuesdays from 5:30PM-6:30PM
- Email [c101@hyland.com](mailto:c101@hyland.com) with any questions

### Weekly Plan
Each week, follow the same type of agenda we normally would follow in class:

1. **Lecture**: watch any lecture recordings before Office Hours on Tuesday
1. **Code-Along**: watch any code-along recordings before Office Hours, OR start watching when Office Hours start so you can ask the instructors questions as you complete the activity
1. **Individual Exercises**: work on the individual exercises during Office Hours and ask the instructors questions as you complete the activities, OR complete the activities before Office Hours and login to Zoom to ask your questions
1. **Challenges**: work on the challenges after completing the code-along
